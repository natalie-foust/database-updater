What is this?
#############
This is a python application I wrote for a specific purpose. A website I was working with was having trouble where their database was being updated in an insecure and unreliable way, and no one was really aware of how it worked.
I went into the PHP application that was updating the code and created this python application from it, to replace that old functionality with this more robust and more adaptable code.
I set this code up on a Cron job on an AWS machine, and it is still maintaining the database today.

Why are some parts blanked out or missing?

I wanted to upload this code so that I could continue to work on it as an independent tool, and I uploaded it as a demonstration of my coding style. 
However, in the interest of privacy for the company which I created this code for, I hid any information referencing their databases specifically.
